  📄 https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12096  
  💻 https://github.com/chengzhag/PanSplat  
 _Tags_: `3DGS`, `panorama`, `feed-forward`,`feature pyramid network`  
TLDR:A feed-forward method to reconstruct gaussians scene, enable the use of high resolution panorama images as input.

- **OmniGS**  
  📄 https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03202  
  💻 https://github.com/liquorleaf/OmniGS  
 _Tags_: `3DGS`, `panorama`, `optimization`,`rasterization`  
TLDR:A 3DGS reconstruction method based on optimization was proposed, and a rasterization renderer for panoramic images was designed.

- **SC-OmniGS**  
  📄 https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04734  
  💻 https://github.com/chenyingshu/sc-omnigs  
 _Tags_: `3DGS`, `panorama`, `optimization`,`self-calibrating`   
TLDR:An optimization-based 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction method for panoramic images, which is able to self-calibrate camera poses using only image inputs, and rectifies the panoramic sphere to reduce distortion effects.

# Generation 
- **DiT**  
  📄 https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09748  
  💻 https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT  
 _Tags_: `latent diffusion`, `transformer`, `feed-forward`    
TLDR:A feed-forward Transformer-based latent diffusion model that replaces U-Nets and exhibits strong compute–quality scaling.

# Depth Estimation
- **Depth Any Panoramas**  
  📄 https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16913  
  💻 https://github.com/Insta360-Research-Team/DAP   
 _Tags_: `depth`, `panorama`, `feed-forward`,`pseudo-label`  
TLDR:A feed-forward method to get the depth map of panoramas, using the pseudo label to guarantee the quality of datasets.

# Mathematical Fundamentals

  📄 https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04454  
 _Tags_: `position encoding`, `spherical`, `RoPE`   
TLDR:A RoPE-based spherical position encoding method that can function in a spherical coordinate system.

  _Tags_: `position encoding`, `cross-views`, `RoPE`, `Raymap`  
TLDR:A new method to encode cross views input, which can maintain the consistency of the geometry struction.
